# Indy Hall - The Original Coworking Community in Philadelphia

A Better Place to Work Starts with Better Coworkers.
We are a community of people who choose to work together, more productively, to make our work, our lives, our cities and communities better.

Indy Hall’s community is the intersection of designers, developers, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, scientists, educators, small business owners, telecommuters, marketers, videographers, game developers, and more.

The only thing we’re missing is you.
