# The Original Coworking Community in Philadelphia

A Better Place to Work Starts with Better Coworkers.
We are a community of people who choose to work together, more productively, to make our work, our lives, our cities and communities better.

Indy Hall’s community is the intersection of designers, developers, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, scientists, educators, small business owners, telecommuters, marketers, videographers, game developers, and more.

The only thing we’re missing is you.

## Works Well with Others

Imagine having coworkers you enjoyed sharing your time with, both inside and outside of work.

Indy Hall is home to the coworkers you always wanted. You'll have endless opportunities to meet new colleagues — and to become new friends — every day. Every week. All the time.

## Purpose

For Indy Hall, our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love.

The Greeks had a word - eudaimonia - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as "...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."

Sound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.

At the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.

We believe in sharing the good life & actively working towards it together.

Come pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!

### How we do it

**We always:**

...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.
...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.
...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.
...trust people to do the right thing.
...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.
...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.

**We never:**

...do anything against our community’s interest.
...focus on desks or square footage.
...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.
...accept the status quo.
...accept a "no" at face value.
...compromise our core values.
...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.

**Every day, we:**

...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.
...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.
...always look for a way to say yes.
...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.

## Room for Serendipity
We took a good hard look at an office, stripped away the obstacles, and focused on making the best parts even better. 
Productivity basics are included: comfortable work & meeting spaces, fast internet, great coffee, & friendly coworkers.

At Indy Hall, spontaneous conversations are our greatest natural resource, followed only by the motivation from being surrounded by coworkers who actually give a damn. We dare you not to be inspired to do your best work while you’re a member of Indy Hall.

## Blocks from the Birthplace of America
Our coworking space is located just north of the intersection of 3rd Street and Market Street. We're proud residents of Old City Philadelphia, just blocks away from the cobblestone steps that lead to our namesake Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. We love this neighborhood because it is full of creativity and life, including plentiful bars and restaurants for meals and meetings, boutiques and art galleries to shop at and enjoy.

You won't be able to walk a full block without bumping into other people from the creative, technology, and entrepreneurial community in Philadelphia. Ben Franklin hung out in these parts a couple of centuries ago. If he were still alive today, he'd probably hang out at Indy Hall.

## A few (actual) reasons people say they love Indy Hall

"Indy Hall has helped me take my ideas and work more seriously as a freelancer, by exposing me to so many other independent workers."

"Indy Hall is the reason I have many friends in Philly."

"Indy Hall has helped me find work, do my work, and find others to join my work."

"Indy Hall helps me feel like I am a part of something bigger than just myself — I like feeling like a part of a much bigger team."

"Indy Hall offers a chance to get out of my bubble and gain perspective."
